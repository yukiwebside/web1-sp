  <p>Today I have reviewed a light-hearted film, Kung Fu Panda which was directed in 2008. 
  This film is comedic cartoon which can always give people fun so that it is a good way for
  people to release pressure. The plot of forty-five minutes showed that lazy panda was addicted 
  to studying Chinese Kung Fu. One time he was chosen to fight with evil leopard accidentally. 
  But there was a big problem that the panda actually did not possess an ability to complete this duty. 
  Then the film showed how the panda was trained as a Kung Fu master to fight evil.</p>
  <p>The film contains lots of culture of China such as Kung Fu, food, spirits. Although 
  actions of panda were very silly, a character of the panda is worth for me to studying. 
  For example, it was hard for panda to study Kung Fu because he was fat. Panda always wanted to give up 
  learning Kung Fu. When he gained encouragements of others, he could be more confident and possess more 
  perseverance to finish training. Also, his classmates accompanied him to overcome challenging This phenomenon
  is called collectivism which belongs to the character of Chinese. Hence, I rate this film at 5 stars. </p>
