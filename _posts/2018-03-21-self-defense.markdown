  <h2>Recently final week is coming. When you study very late at school, it is so dangerous to go home, especially for girls. Hence, I have reseached some protection measures for us.</h2>
<div class="context">
  <ul>
    <li>Tip one: Stand your ground, defend yourself and others against bullying and mistreatment and simply don't let others walk all over you.</li>
    <li>Tip two: Don't trust anyone completely except your parents.</li>
    <li>Tip three: Observe your environment constantly can carefully. If you know someone nearby that you're passing, by           immediately move to their home. If possible, make a call to your friend and let them know you suspect you're being             followed. Let them know about your location and every move you're taking. You will protect both yourself and your friend       that way.</li>
    <li>Tip four: Learn to say no, and don't accept anything from strangers, such as water, food, etc.</li>
    <li>Tip five: Don't randomly accept transportation. This goes for girls and guys. Just don't do it. Even if you know them from school or somewhere else, it's just not safe. If you leave with somebody, your chances of survival are greatly diminished.</li>
    <li>Tip six: Take someone with you. If you have the chance to take someone, tell him/her or a group of friends to walk around with you. You'll have a lower chance of being attacked when walking in groups.</li>
    <li>Tip seven: Use technology. Our technology is very advanced.</li>
