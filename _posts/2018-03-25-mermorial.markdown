			<p>Today, I go to visit the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C, designed by Maya Lin and completed in 1981.
      From the picture, it is obvious that material of the memorial’s wall is granite. In my mind, granite 
      is firm and can stand up for a long time. The color of wall is black and text is white. As a memorial, 
      the designer did bot use colorful text so that it shows appear simplify and transcendent. The memorial is not
      huge according to comparing with trees in the photograph. Therefore, it is not easy for people to find the memorial. 
      The reason why I choose this building is that this building does not have roof, window, door which included by any 
      other buildings. It is open in the public area. In addition, the shape of the memorial is like combined with two 
      triangles and arms of two walls towards the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial. There is no denying that 
      lots of people arrive at the center of Washington, D.C, to see the special shape of the memorial. However, 
      from my perspective, the most appealing place is names of “57692 Americans” who sacrificed in Vietnam from 1963 to 1973”.
      Around the memorial, there are trees, grass. The location of Vietnam Veterans Memorial looks like in a park. 
      The park is these dead’s home. Then the memorial is not only a building but also processing souls which connect
      with people. Therefore, I think the Vietnam Veterans Memorial have elements of architecture “commodity, firmness, 
      and delight” which is claimed by Vitruvius. </p>
