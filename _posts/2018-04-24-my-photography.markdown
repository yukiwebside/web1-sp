  <p>Everyone is ordinary, but he or she also possesses special status in the society. 
  As a student, he or she needs to study hardly for the better future life; as a teacher, 
  he or she needs to impart knowledge; as a police, he or she needs to protect the safety of citizens; 
  as a cleaner, he or she needs to keep the environment clean and tidy; as a chef, he or she needs to ensure 
  that the food tastes well. There is no denying that people are stressed out at work. In the free time,
  people can more flexibly control their time to do what they want to do. We can see from the small details 
  of life that people can enjoy the life such as talking with friends, reading books, and so on. However, 
  finally I want to identify that even though people are working, they are also enjoying their working.
  Enjoying life isn't only relax yourself, but also it's about putting yourself in the right place. 
  Like now I am writing my introduction of the project.  This process of writing is also a process of  my enjoyment life. 
  Hence, actually enjoying the life means to be yourself and make yourself to be more reality in any time.</p>
