  <p>I input some keywords like the book review, Adam Benforado's Unfair in the Google engine, 
  and then I find Carina Giesen’s review of this book.  I agree with Carina Giesen’s view that
  criminal injustice actually exists in the society, including bias and false labels in people 
  minds, coercionary confession, and using a mug shot to judge suspects. These things are all that
  we ignore when we are in the process of looking for real prisoners. From the perspective of my, 
  Carina Giesen’s book review possesses explicit structure about Unfair: The New Science of Criminal
  Injustice because The author firstly claims brief introductions of this book, and then states her argument
  that “unfair is a book about a lot of things that are wrong with the U.S. legal system.” Continually, Giesen
  introduces roughly nine chapters which are included in the book. In my view, the author should review every 
  chapter with combining some specific examples and quotations written in the Unfair to give good understanding
  for readers. Finally, the author writes the reason why she recommends others to read, which I think is one of 
  the most important parts in the book review.</p>
