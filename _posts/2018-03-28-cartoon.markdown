  <p>This image is a famous cartoon called BoJack Horseman and made by Tornante Company in Hollywood. 
  The main character is a horseman called  BoJack who likes drinking Whiskey. He has a horse head, 
  a human body which is attractive to me firstly. He is a thirty-year-old man who wears a blue sweater, 
  a black coat and a blue jean and chats with his friend, Todd, at night. The whole cartoon tells us about 
  BoJack with his partner Todd how to deal with their difficulties in their daily life, which imitate the real life of people.
  What the most impression on me is that everyone is exposed his or her characters when he or she deals with things,
  such as lonely, weakness, selfish and what not. However, there are lots of wisdom sentence 
  in this cartoon which can inspire people solve or challenge trouble in life. </p>
  <p>On the picture, BoJack has said a sentence with frowning “You know what the problem with everybody? 
  They all just want to hear what they already believe. No one ever wants to hear the truth. ”
  It is acknowledged that saying of BoJack reflects a bad phenomenon in the society. 
  For example, your employer makes a mistake and you make a point to let him or her know. 
  But he or she will be angry listening to your advice because the employer thinks you make him or she embarrassed. 
  Also the employer insists his or her ways to do work and has a bad impression on you finally.  
  If others praise for your employer  and think the way of employer is right at that time, the employer will be very happy.
  Therefore, lots of employees ingratiate themselves with their employers in order to gain more benefits. 
  Although people always think cartoons are puerile, BoJack Horseman can teach us some wisdom of life by using comedic way. </p>
