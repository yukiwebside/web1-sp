  <p>There is an article “ why we should stop graphing students on a curve” on the New York Times. 
  The author,Adam Grant, said that a forced graphing curve not only reduces student to create 
  a hypercompetitive culture but also sends students the message that the world is a 
  zero-sum game: your success means my failure. Some years into the author’s career, 
  he encourages students to encourage community and collaboration to assess students individually.</p>
  <p>From my perspective, however, stopping grating students on a curve is not the correct way to reduce the 
  pressure from students. As long as you have a strong perveverance, hard-working or a correct direction, you also can get good grades. 
  The author, Adam Grant, believes students should not have competition, but I think competition is a necessary element 
  which exists in the study because students do not have the motivation to possess a good grade which is B or A without 
  competition. When they encounter some difficulties in the study, they will be more reliance on others who 
  are very hardworking and intelligent. Hence, sometimes teachers need to send some warning atmosphere to the students, 
  which can make them have more concentrations on their study. In addition, in this large quantity of population, 
  employment is also a big problem in the society. If you cannot get a good grade in top twenty persents of students,
  you may not make a deeper impression to your professor, which might cause your professors cannot make a good recommendation 
  to companies. Also probabilities of your employment will be lower than others. Hence we might not stop graphing students on 
  a curve, but we need to sometimes employ the curve properly so that students might be motivated to study hardly.</p>
